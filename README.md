# Linux Kernel

The code is based on questions from the textbook, **Operating System Concepts, 9th Edition by Abraham Silberschatz**.

## Description of files:
`linux_kernel_linked_list.c`: This program creates a linked list containing five struct birthday
elements, traverses the linked list and outputs its contents to the kernel log buffer. It then deletes the elements from the linked list and returns the free memory back to the kernel.
